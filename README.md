#PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Birdsong recognition is crucial for ecological monitoring and biodiversity conservation. It helps scientists and conservationists track bird populations, assess environmental health, and detect changes in ecosystems. Birdcalls can vary significantly within and between species. Factors such as environmental noise, overlapping calls, and individual variations further complicate accurate recognition.
